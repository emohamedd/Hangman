# Hangman
<h1>The Hangman Game</h1>
The Hangman game is a word guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time. The player can make up to a certain number of incorrect guesses (usually 6) before they lose the game. Each incorrect guess results in a part of a stick figure being drawn, until the figure is fully drawn and the player loses.

<h1>How to Play</h1>
A word is chosen by the person setting up the game and is hidden from the player.
The player makes a guess of a letter.
The computer checks if the guessed letter is in the hidden word.
If the letter is in the word, the computer reveals all occurrences of that letter in the word.
If the letter is not in the word, the player loses one strike and a part of the stick figure is drawn.
The player continues to guess letters until either the word is completely revealed or the player runs out of strikes.
